# Blindraw 🎨🕵️‍♂️

## Basic Details

### Team Name: 444

### Team Members
- Team Lead: **Muhammed Dilshan** – SOE<CUSAT  
- Member 2: **Muhammed Danish** – SOE<CUSAT  

### Project Description  
An invisible drawing game where you can’t see what you’re drawing – but a totally “real” AI will judge you anyway. Channel your inner Picasso… blindfolded.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
Drawing has gotten too easy. People rely too much on what they can *see*. There’s a clear lack of invisible drawing tools in the world.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We built a platform where your brush strokes vanish instantly. You draw based on memory, luck, and chaos. Then a fake AI rates your sketch and either inflates or crushes your ego. 🎯
