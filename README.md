Project Description
An invisible drawing game where you can’t see what you’re drawing – but a totally “real” AI will judge you anyway. Channel your inner Picasso… blindfolded.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Drawing has gotten too easy. People rely too much on what they can see. There’s a clear lack of invisible drawing tools in the world.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a platform where your brush strokes vanish instantly. You draw based on memory, luck, and chaos. Then a fake AI rates your sketch and either inflates or crushes your ego. 🎯

Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used

Software:

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks: None (we're brave)

Libraries: P5.js (for canvas magic), Howler.js (for audio effects)

One broken mouse.

Two souls and one braincell (shared).

Implementation
Installation

Landing page where you pick a difficulty and pretend to know what’s going on.


The canvas you draw on. But you won’t see a thing. Pure psychological warfare.


Fake AI feedback. Sometimes kind. Usually not.

Diagrams

User clicks start → Draws blindly → Timer ends → Image revealed → Fake AI gives score → User regrets everything.

Hardware Documentation
(We have none. This is a useless software project. But here’s some funny build stuff.)

Schematic & Circuit

An imaginary schematic. This does nothing.
